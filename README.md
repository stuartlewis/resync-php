resync-php
==========

ResourceSync PHP Client Library
 - http://www.openarchives.org/rs/

Test by running 'php test/test.php' from the top-level resync-php directory.

Demo web interface can be enabled by deploying the resync-php directory to your PHP enabled web server.  Please note
that this is not a hardened web application, only a test interface for the library.  The web interface should therefore
not be deployed in a live server.
